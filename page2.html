            <p>I also value the trust you've placed in me when you’ve opened up about the more difficult moments in your life, like the times you had to part ways with someone close to you. I’m sure your parents are proud of what you’ve become. Just like the people who love and support you, I feel the same way—proud of who you are and everything you’ve accomplished.</p>

            <p>I know it hasn’t been easy for you to get to where you are now. So, just so you know again, we’re here if you ever need us. And while I may not be great at giving advice, I’m always here for you if you ever want someone to lean on.</p>
