            <p>To Cyenefın Mnoceur, the person who caught my attention, I want to properly say that I admire you. I know you’re likely aware of this, but I still struggle to admit it openly. It’s just that I feel shy admitting it to you, even though my actions may have already been obvious.</p>

            <p>I know that when we first interacted, you saw me as someone who’s a flirt, and that’s fine. Maybe I came on a bit too strong at that time. But honestly, if I hadn’t acted that way, I might still be a stranger to you.</p>

            <p>I’m really happy to have gotten to know you. I never expected that we would become this close, and the fact that you talk and reply to me often makes me melt (both happy and kilig). Whenever we’re on a call, I genuinely enjoy letting you talk. I love listening to your stories—whether it’s the fun memories with your friends in Baguio, the first time you tried getting into a bar with them, or the freedom you felt while you were there.</p>
